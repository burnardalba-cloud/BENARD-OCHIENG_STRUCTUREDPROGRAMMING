1.A normal variable directly stores a value, such as an integer or a character, inside its own memory location. When you access or modify a normal variable, you work with that value directly using the variable’s name.
A pointer, on the other hand, stores the memory address of another variable rather than the value itself. Memory is accessed indirectly through the pointer: you first use the pointer to reach the address, and then dereference it with the * operator to read or modify the value stored at that address.

2.Variable declaration introduces a variable by specifying its type and name, while definition allocates memory for it. For example, int x; both declares and defines an integer variable x because memory is reserved for storing its value.
Pointer declaration introduces a pointer variable that can store the address of another variable, while definition allocates memory for the pointer itself. For example, int *p; declares and defines a pointer p that can hold the address of an integer.
The operator * is used in two contexts: during pointer declaration, it specifies that the variable is a pointer type (e.g., int *p; means p is a pointer to an integer), and during dereferencing, it accesses the value stored at the address held by the pointer (e.g., *p = 10; assigns 10 to the variable whose address is stored in p).
The operator & is used to obtain the address of a variable. For example, if int x = 5;, then &x gives the memory address of x. Assigning p = &x; stores the address of x in the pointer p.


3.Dereferencing a pointer means accessing the value stored at the memory address that the pointer is pointing to.
For example, consider the following statements in C:
int x = 10;         
int *p;              
p = &x;              

printf("%d", *p);
(Here, *p accesses the value of x through the pointer.)

Dereferencing can also be used to modify the value stored at the memory address:
*p = 20;             
printf("%d", x);  
(dereferencing a pointer allows both reading and writing of the value stored at the memory location it points to)

4.Pointers are preferred when direct memory access or efficient data handling is needed.
Example 1: Dynamic memory allocation.
int *arr = (int*)malloc(10 * sizeof(int)); 
(Here, pointers allow flexible array sizes, unlike normal variables)
Example 2: Function arguments.
void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a; *a = *b; *b = temp;
}
Pointers let functions modify actual variable values, not just copies.
They are also essential in building linked lists and trees, where nodes connect via addresses.

5.Complexity: Pointers make code harder to read and debug.
Dangling pointers: Using a pointer after freeing memory can cause crashes.
Memory leaks: Forgetting to free dynamically allocated memory wastes resources.
Invalid access: Dereferencing uninitialized or NULL pointers leads to runtime errors.Invalid access: Dereferencing uninitialized or NULL pointers leads to runtime errors.
Security risks: Improper pointer use can cause buffer overflows and vulnerabilities.


6.Call by Value: The function receives a copy of the variable’s value. Changes inside the function do not affect the original variable.
Example:void func(int a) { a = 20; }
int x = 10; func(x); 

Call by Reference: The function receives the variable’s address through a pointer. Changes inside the function affect the original variable.
Example:void func(int *a) { *a = 20; }
int x = 10; func(&x); 

In call by value, data is passed as a copy, while in call by reference, data is passed via memory address.


7.a. Call by value is preferred when the function should not alter the original data.
Example: passing numbers to a function that only performs calculations, like finding the square of a number.
b. Call by reference is preferred when the function needs to modify the original data.
Example: swapping two variables or updating elements in a linked list directly through their addresses.
